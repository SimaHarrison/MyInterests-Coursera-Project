        <h2> First, a little back story if you will... </h2>
        <p> My new husband is a programmer for a software company here in WA, go figure, one of the tech capitals of the
            world. I decided I would like to better understand what he does in his day, and better understand what hes
            talking about when he tells me about his day and whats going on for him. He is a Full Stack developer, but
            he knows ALOT of computer languages, and recommending me starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>

        <h2> Now that you're all caught up with my story... </h2>
        <p> I don't have too many hobbies, I'm currently a stay at home Wifey, I was a Barber for many years till COVID
            shut down all the salons in my area. Now I just spend my days doing crafts, or video games. I also just
            spend alot of time with my Cat, "Razputin the Kitty Warmind" if you know, you know. </p>

        <h2> A few of my Craft Hobbies include; </h2>
        <h4> *Crochet </h4>
        <p> I crochet all sorts of things, I have done it since I was about 5yo, and it has always been a good relaxing
            task for myself.</p>
        <h4> *Yarn collecting</h4>
        <p>If you ask my Husband, its really more of an addiction. But it is exactly how it sounds, I horde massive
            amounts of varying colors and/or textures of yarn. </p>
        <h4> *Processing Fibers</h4>
        <p> I do this process with my Mom. It starts with getting it from a local farmer, we use Alpaca.</p>
        <p> We then wash it, spin it to get all the extra water out, then hang it to dry before hand carding it and
            spining it into fiber with a Drop Spindle. </p>
